#**Capstone 1**

The data we are going to be analyzing today is a current report of the top 500 artists in ascending order from Spotify's rankings system.
Each artist in the data spread has attached statistics of their numbers on other social media platforms, along with listening platforms such as Beatport.

We will be looking into the data to find correlations on all angles with a focus on the genre of the artist. Other metrics such as popularity, what creates different parameters of popularity,
and the difference between artist rankings will be discussed to see if anything has an effect on fan engagement with the artist.


IMPORTS

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(conflicted)
dplyr::filter
```

Hypothesis : The difference in each social media following statistics or listening platform statistics has a direct correlation to the general genre of the artist, showing that each online music store has an association with a specific group of musical genres, differing from other online music stores. 


Reading in the file


```{r}
df <- read.csv('/home/user/Documents/coding_temple/Capstone/capstone1/spotify_top_500_artists.csv')

```

```{r}
df
```

Beginning to clean the data, starting with the columns

```{r}
clean_cols <- function(x){
  # Names is an attribute of the dataframe object. That object is the columns.
  names(x) <- tolower(names(x)) %>% str_replace_all("\\.", "_")
 
  return(x)
}
df <- clean_cols(df)
df
```

```{r}
#dropping columns with incomplete data and merging two identical columns "rank" and "spotify_rank"
dforg <- df[-c(6,7,9,11,15,17,19,22,24,25,26,28,29,31,33,34,36,38,39,41,42,43,48)]
dforg <- dforg %>% rename("spotify_rank" = "rank")
```

```{r}
dforg
```

```{r}
#replacing N/A with NA's to identify null values in the dataframe
dforg[dforg == "N/A"] <- NA
```

Dealing with null values

```{r}
dforg  %>% summarize(na_count = sum(is.na(dforg)))
colSums(is.na(dforg))
```
```{r}
dforg
```

Replacing the null values with 0's seems to be the better option over filtering them out, since this data is dealing with if somebody is using a 
platform
```{r}
dforg <- dforg %>% replace_na(list(x=0,y='unknown'))
```

checking again

```{r}
sum(colSums(is.na(dforg)))
```

The data is organized and clean. Now we will turn it into a csv to export
```{r}

write.csv(dforg, "Spotify_Rankings_Data.csv")
```

Now that we have clean data, lets do our analyzing and see what we find


The first question that I want to look into, going back to my original hypothesis is all about the genre. Popularity patterns can happen anywhere! maybe certain areas 
encourage imitation of your culture's favorites?


Hypothesis:
  
H0:  Genre per artist has no effect on the difference in social media statistics

H1:  Genre per artist has a direct effect on the difference in social media statistics



We will see whether the hypothesis will be rejected or failed to reject

```{r}
dforg %>% 
    arrange(genre)%>%
    slice(1:30) %>%
    ggplot(. ,aes(genre, spotify_monthly_listeners_total))
```

```{r}
dforg %>% 
    arrange(genre)%>%
    slice(1:30) %>%
    ggplot(. ,aes(genre, spotify_followers_total))+
```


```{r}
dforg %>% 
    arrange(genre)%>%
    slice(1:30) %>%
    ggplot(. ,aes(genre, spotify_playlist_reach_total))+
```

```{r}
dforg %>% 
    arrange(genre)%>%
    slice(1:30) %>%
    ggplot(. ,aes(genre, twitter_followers_total))+
```

```{r}
dforg %>% 
    arrange(genre)%>%
    slice(1:30) %>%
    ggplot(. ,aes(genre, instagram_followers_total))+
```
The results from these charts show that it would appear the two do not have a strong relationship at all. The difference between
following comparatively have a similar spread, thus we can assume that it is more just patterns of 
each platform that play a bigger role in the following count, rather than the genre of the artist.

This means we would fail to reject the null hypothesis 


Hypothesis:
  
H0:  The following an artist has on one social media does not have any effect on their following count comparatively

H1:  The following that each artist has does indeed have a direct effect on their following count comparatively


We will find this out by performing correlation tests between their followings, and comparing the co-effecient's to see if they are consistent or not

We will perform a test to see whether the hypothesis will be rejected or failed to reject
```{r}
tester = cor.test(dforg$twitter_followers_total,dforg$spotify_followers_total)
tester

```



```{r}
tester = cor.test(dforg$instagram_followers_total,dforg$facebook_followers_total)
tester

```

```{r}
tester = cor.test(dforg$deezer_fans_total,dforg$tiktok_followers_total)
tester

```

The results show that it would appear the there is a significant medium positive relationship between twitter and spotify followings.
the p-value between twitter and spotify was 0.00081
the correlation coefficient was .3313

on this next test, there may have been bias introduced. Facebook and Instagram are under the same ownership, this was not taken into consideration 
originally. The companies have the same promotional algorithms and trend patterns so this data most liekly will not show the same relationship.
the p-value between facebook and instagram was	1.225e-11
the correlation coefficient was .6153

The correlation coefficient between deezer and tiktok was a negative value of -0.231 and the p-value was .8205
These points signify that there is a non significant, very small negative relationship between the following statistics of the 
two platforms.

Big difference between these three tests! These conclusions show that we can fail to reject the original hypothesis, meaning there
does not seem to be any real significant correlation between the following statistics, and the following an artist has on one platform
does not necessarily reflect on others



Hypothesis:
  
H0:  The statistical difference between how many monthly followers an artist has and how many monthly plays they get does not play a role in Spotify's ranking result

H1:  The statistical difference between how many monthly followers an artist has and how many monthly plays they get had a direct effect on Spotify's ranking result

This will be fun since the ranking is ordered in a linear fashion



We will perform a test to see whether the hypothesis will be rejected or failed to reject

Let's see if there is a correlation between the different spotify statistics

```{r}
tester = cor.test(dforg$spotify_rank,dforg$spotify_followers_total)
tester
```

```{r}
tester = cor.test(dforg$spotify_rank,dforg$spotify_monthly_listeners_total)
tester
```

lets try some mapping
```{r}
ggplot(data = dforg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x =spotify_rank , y = spotify_monthly_listeners_total))
```

between spotify rank, and spotify following, the correlation coefficient was -0.7475 and the p-value <.001, at 9.446e-19
These show that there is a significant very small negative relationship between the rank and follower count

next, were checking monthly listeners
The correlation coefficient was -0.766 and the p-value was 1.619e-20, or <.001. even smaller than the last!

The results all support the alternative hypothesis that how many followers an artist has and how many monthly listeners they have has a direct relationship 
with the platforms ranking system. Seems to add up right?
